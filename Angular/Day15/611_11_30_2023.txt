Today Lecture
1 Http Method
	1 get  => fetch/get the data from backend server 
	2 post => To send a data from frontend to back end server  
	3 put  => to update a data  
	4 delete => to delete a data 
	
2 http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts
	
	- It is fake service bcz it can not store a data into database (get/post/put/delete)=> it can reflect changes into ur database but it gives a response of ur request
